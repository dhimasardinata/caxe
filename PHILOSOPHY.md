# 🪓 CAXE — RAW PHILOSOPHY

> **Caxe exists to reduce human suffering caused by native build systems.**

---

Caxe is built on the belief that:

Complexity in C and C++ is real, unavoidable, and earned over decades.
But *unnecessary cognitive load* is not.

Caxe does not aim to eliminate complexity.
It aims to **carry it for the user, until the user is ready to carry it themselves.**

---

Caxe treats the user as someone who is learning —
even if they are already an expert.

---

## Core Beliefs

* Users should be able to build before they understand.
* Users should be able to understand everything they build.
* No decision should be invisible.
* No failure should be unexplained.
* No convenience should permanently block mastery.

---

## About Simplicity

Simplicity is not achieved by hiding reality.

Simplicity is achieved by:

* delaying decisions,
* choosing sensible defaults,
* and revealing truth progressively.

---

## About Intelligence

Caxe is intelligent only when it can explain itself.

Heuristics must:

* be deterministic,
* be inspectable,
* be overridable.

Any behavior that cannot be explained is considered a bug.

---

## About Zero Configuration

Zero configuration means:

* zero *required* decisions,
* not zero decisions.

Caxe may decide on behalf of the user,
but it must never pretend the decision did not exist.

---

## About Growth

Caxe must never force users to abandon it as they grow.

A beginner's project and an expert's project should share the same mental model.
Only the *depth of visibility* should change.

---

## About Power

Power is granted gradually.

Caxe starts as a guide,
becomes an assistant,
and eventually steps aside.

---

## About Failure

Failure is not an error state.
Failure is an educational moment.

Error messages are part of the product.

---

## About Scope

Caxe does not aim to solve every problem.

It chooses clarity over generality.
It chooses honesty over flexibility.
It chooses human time over machine cleverness.

---

## Final Principle

> **If a user cannot explain what Caxe did,
> then Caxe has failed — even if the build succeeded.**

---

## One-Line North Star

> **Build first.
> Understand forever.**
