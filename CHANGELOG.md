## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.9] - 2026-02-16

- Clarified framework support levels in `cx framework` with explicit statuses:
  - `daxe`: `integrated`
  - `fmt`, `spdlog`, `json`, `catch2`: `dependency-alias`
- `cx framework add <name>` now rejects dependency-alias entries with non-zero exit and exact `cx add <name>` guidance
- Improved framework info/list output with recommended commands per entry
- Kept backward compatibility for existing `[build].framework` alias values:
  - Build continues with warning
  - Explicit migration hint to `cx add <name>` is shown
- Replaced fragile framework config editing with section-aware `[build]` key mutation/removal logic
- Kept `cx target add/remove/default` visible while marking them deferred in v0.3.x help and runtime output
- Standardized deferred target mutation failures to non-zero with explicit profile-first guidance:
  - configure `[profile:<name>]`
  - run `cx build --profile <name>`
- Improved `cx target list` UX with a clear deferred-status banner and profile-based setup hint
- Added dedicated CI lint gate:
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- Aligned CI test execution to explicit target coverage:
  - `cargo test --all-targets --verbose`
- Added targeted regression coverage for framework metadata/mutation behavior and target deferred messaging/help surface
- Included dependency and workflow updates already present in `HEAD` (cargo deps + GitHub Actions deps bumps)
- Fixed pure C builds to use the detected C compiler instead of the C++ driver
- Hardened self-upgrade path resolution and cleaned Unix clippy warnings in release-gated paths

## [0.3.8] - Defects-First Stabilization & Governance 🛠️

- Canonicalized artifact paths to `.cx/<profile>/bin` across build/package/IDE/docker flows
- Updated `cx watch` non-test mode to rebuild-only behavior (no auto-run)
- Made `cx lock --check` strict (missing/extra/URL mismatch) and `cx sync` fail-fast on stale lockfiles
- Made `cx target add/remove/default` explicit deferred operations with non-zero exit and `--profile` guidance
- Added deterministic object naming and improved test recompilation freshness logic
- Persisted import source scanning for non-`src` project layouts
- Improved performance in cache pruning, dependency fetching, and package zip streaming
- Added dual licensing (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`) with `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`
- Added contributor/community governance docs and templates (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue/PR templates)
- Expanded test coverage and module documentation
- Improved CLI maintainability with extracted command handlers and safer progress-style fallbacks
